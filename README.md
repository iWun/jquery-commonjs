# jquery-commonjs
Older versions of jquery packaged as commonjs modules.

These legacy jquery modules have been modified to default export the jquery object($).  These modules also will not add `jQuery` or `$` to the global namespace (window).  For all versions the source code has been minified.

The following jquery versions are available (via the following git tags and associated package.json git URLs)
- `v1.7.2`: `git://github.com/optimizely/jquery-commonjs.git#v1.7.2`
- `v1.8.3`: `git://github.com/optimizely/jquery-commonjs.git#v1.8.3`
